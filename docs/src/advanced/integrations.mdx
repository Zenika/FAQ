# Integrations

This project has the following integrations:

- [Slack](#/advanced/integrations#slack)
- [Workplace](/advanced/integrations/#workplace)
- [Public API](/advanced/integrations/#public-api)

## Slack

Slack is a collaboration chat tool often used in and out of organizations to help team communicate and coordinate in a more effective manner.

FAQ has the following integration with slack:

- Sends new questions into a dedicated slack channel

### Create Slack application

In order to integrate with Slack, you will need to create an application. It can be done using the [Slack "Build" dashboard](https://api.slack.com/). Follow the instructions from Slack to create your app. See below for your configuration variables.

### Configuration variables

| Name               | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `slackChannelHook` | This variable is a hook URI which is called by the backend in order to send the message to the channel. You can configure a hook on the [Slack "Build" dashboard](https://api.slack.com/). Choose your app, then go to "Features > Incoming Webhooks". Active the feature and create a hook for the dedicated channel you wish to send questions to. The generated url is what you need for this variable. |

## Workplace

Workplace is a collaborative platform run by Facebook and can be labeled as "Facebook for companies".

FAQ has the following integration with Workplace:

- Button to share a question on Workplace

### Configuration

There is no configuration needed for the workplace integration to work. Indeed, to share something with the Worplace API, we only need to open a popup with this url: `https://work.facebook.com/sharer.php?display=popup&u=[the_url_to_share]`

## Public API

FAQ has a public API in order to query its data.

### Configuration

1. Manually create a user with a `key` (You can use any string as a key, but we advise you to use a random 30 chars long string). You can create it using the Prisma Playground (probably https://localhost:4466 if you followed the installation process).

   ```graphql
   mutation {
     createUser(
       data: {
         key: "awesome-key"
         name: "API"
         email: "awesome-api@zenika.com"
         group: { connect: { slug: "general" } }
       }
     ) {
       id
       key
       name
       email
     }
   }
   ```

2. Create a JWT with the following payload, sign with the previously created key. (You can find more information about how to create a JWT and librairies [here](https://jwt.io/))

   ```
   {
     "userId": "[user_id]",
     "prismaService": "[name]/[stage]",
     "iat": [timestamp_generated],
     "exp": [timestamp_expiration]
   }
   ```

   > `userId` is the id of the user created in step 1

   > `prismaService` is the service you want to access (See [Multi-tenancy](/advanced/multi-tenancy) for more information)

   > `iat` is the current timestamp

   > `exp` is the current timestamp + the number of seconds you want the token to be valid

   Example:

   ```js
   {
     "userId": "cjmymlydx01780b30irsmi203",
     "prismaService": "demo/prod",
     "iat": 1538908112,
     "exp": 1538910112
   }
   ```

   > Here, `exp` = `iat` + 2000s. This token would be available for around half an hour.

3. Query the backend with an HTTP POST request with your GraphQL as the body. Add the following headers:

   ```
   Authorization: API [your_jwt_token]
   prisma-service: [name]/[state]
   ```
