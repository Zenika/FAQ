Below are some useful information in order to get you started.

You will need to follow the [installation process](/advanced/getting-started) first.

## Contributing process

## Documentation

The documentation is generated using [docz](https://docz.site).

```bash
# Path: ./FAQ/docs
npm run start
```

Build the documentation:

```bash
# Path: ./FAQ/docs
npm run build

## Tests

> There is currently no tests for this project

## Linting

You can use the following commands either in the frontend (`./client`) or the backend (`./server`)

```bash
npm run lint           #Check with eslint
npm run lint:fix       #Fix with eslint
npm run prettier:check #Check with prettier
npm run prettier:write #Fix with prettier
```

## Bundle size

We try to minimize the size of the js bundle. You can use the webpack analyzer to check if new dependencies are lightweight or not.

```bash
npm run stats
```

This commands generate a `stats.json` file which you can vizualize on this [website](https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/)
