## Linting

## Bundle size

We try to minimize the size of the js bundle. You can use the webpack analyzer to check if new dependencies are lightweight or not.

```bash
npm run stats
```

This commands generate a `stats.json` file which you can vizualize on this [website](https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/)
