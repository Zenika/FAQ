# Installation

Here are the instructions to quickly install and run this project with the minimum [backing services](/advanced/backing-services) required.

## 1/ Global dependencies

First, you will need the following dependencies:

- Docker >= 16 and docker-compose >= 1.18 (See https://www.docker.com)
- Node >= 8 and npm >= 5 (See https://nodejs.org)

> These are the currently known minimum versions required. Earlier versions may still work.

## 2/ Clone repository

Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenika-open-source/FAQ
```

## 3/ Install project dependencies

```bash
# Path: ./FAQ/client
npm install

# Path: ./FAQ/server
npm install
```

## 4/ Create your environment files

This project uses 2 `.env.local` file to configure its environment variables.

- The first `.env.local` file (for the frontend) needs to be created in the `client` folder.

```
REACT_APP_FAQ_URL=faq.zenika.com

REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4000/gql
REACT_APP_PRISMA_SERVICE=default/default
```

- The second `.env.local` file (for the backend) needs to be created in the `server` folder.

```
PRISMA_URL=http://localhost:4466
PRISMA_API_SECRET=secret-42
PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET=my-secret-42
```

## 5/ Initialize local Prisma instance

```bash
# Path: ./FAQ/server/prisma
PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET=my-secret-42 docker-compose up
```

## 6/ Deploy and initialize your default service

You will need your Auth0 credentials for this step.

If you have a zenika.com email address, you can use the following credentials:

> `AUTH0_DOMAIN` = `zenika.eu.auth0.com`
>
> `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` = `wq8LU1f5iXQ4HWL0F6Z07QDcSMgWPd1p`

Otherwise, you can find them on your [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com).

```bash
# Path: ./FAQ/server
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your_domain AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id npm run new_service
```

## 7/ Run the backend

```bash
# Path: ./FAQ/server
npm start
```

## 8/ Run the frontend

```bash
# Path: ./FAQ/client
npm start
```

And you should now have an up and running FAQ at http://localhost:3000! ðŸŽ‰

But wait! It's only the slim version with only the required backing services. If you want to activate more features (e.g.: Algolia, Slack, Mailgun, ...), you will need to follow the [full configuration instructions](/advanced/configuration).
